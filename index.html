<h1 style="color:white">ESP Questions</h1>


<p>1. Have you ever experienced not forgiving someone asking for
your forgiveness? Why?</p>
<p>Ans: No.</p>

<p>2. How does it affects you when you reject someone asking for
your forgiveness?</p>
<p>Ans: I had never rejected anyone who asked for my forgiveness to my knowledge, though I would assume I may feel guilty for rejecting them, or sad or perhaps dejected.</p>

<p>3. How about when someone is rejecting you when you ask for
their forgiveness?</p>
<p>Ans: I would be sad that they didn't accept but move on since I have other things to focus on.</p>

<p>4. Why is it important for you to forgive someone?</p>
<p>Ans: They knew what they did was wrong and came to you and asked for forgiveness, so shouldn't you reward them for doing the right thing? </p>

<p>5. What advice can you tell to all the people having a hard time
forgiving someone?</p>
<p>Ans: If it is hard to say "I forgive you" then try and think what if instead of him/her asking you for forgiveness it was switched? You would want to be forgiven, right? So go ahead and forgive them, you wouldn't want to ruin others' day.</p>





  <h1 style="color:white">TLE Questions</h1>

<p>1. How will you define social development?</p>
<p>PS: They all have answers about socializing with other people, however, I decided to give them a brief description of what is meant since otherwise, they would be talking about something else.</p>
 <p>Ans: The act of allowing a child to experience social interaction over the course of their youth, which will affect how they think, feel, and behave, towards others. </p>


<p>2. Why it is important to have initial relationships?</p>
<p>Ans: It allows the child to feel safe in an environment, it can serve as a base for the child's growth, allow the child to explore and sharpen their curiosity and understanding of the world, etc.</p>

<p>3. How does socialization important in the process of social development?</p>
  <p>Ans: As mentioned before it affects how they think, feel, and behave, towards others. </p>
